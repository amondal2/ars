## ease of accessing package, help, tests:

Fine, though instructions for using package should rely on it being a package and not load_all().

## main help page:

Clear. No information about the ARS algorithm. No example usage.

## quality of user interface:

Requires user to give location, scale to help with starting points. In general allowing user to provide such info but not requiring it would be best.

## performance on my tests:

Can't handle narrow normal density centered at 40 (won't run)
Starting value issues with truncated normal densities (various R errors, so doesn't run), because code assumes mode is not at boundary.
Passes K-S test for double exponential only if give actual mode as 'location'; otherwise fails. 

## t density output:

Detects non-log-concavity.

## presence of tests:

Tests pass.

K-S tests for a few distributions
tested Cauchy
a few tests of inputs
limited unit tests

## code efficiency:

Fast: 0.35 sec. for 5000 samples

Very nice use of expanding batch size. 

## comments in code:

Good

## code organization/clarity/elegance:

Clearly organized and easy to follow. However, functions such as exp_upper_hull probably best organized by not having nested within main function. These functions also rely on objects not local to the function.

No need to use numerical integration - you can do the integrals in closed form. Your code would likely be really fast if you did the integrals analytically.

## equality of workload:

Good. I like how you divided the coding effort in a way that allowed for real collaboration/discussion. 

## writeup:

Clear. I would have liked to see some demonstration of usage/plotting of results.
